## What is Where2Skate?

**Where2Skate** is a mobile application built with Kotlin for the Android platform, designed to be the ultimate companion for skateboarders. Its core purpose is to create a community-driven map of the best places to skate, from official skateparks to local street spots.

The application allows users to:
1.  Securely register and log in to a personal account.
2.  Discover new skate spots through an interactive map powered by Google Maps.
3.  Contribute to the community by adding new, undiscovered locations.
4.  Rate and review existing spots, helping others find the best places to skate.
5.  Connect with other skaters through a shared platform of locations and feedback.

## Key Features

- **Firebase Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using email and password, managed by Firebase Auth.
- **Interactive Spot Map:** Utilizes the Google Maps SDK for Android to display all user-submitted skate spots as markers on a map, providing an intuitive way to explore.
- **User-Generated Spots (CRUD):** Registered users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for skate spots, making the app's database a living, community-curated resource.
- **Rating & Review System:** A five-star rating system allows users to score spots and leave comments, providing valuable feedback for the community.
- **Real-time Database:** Built on Cloud Firestore, ensuring all spot information and ratings are updated and synced across all users' devices in real-time.
- **Modern Android Tech Stack:** Developed using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose for a declarative and modern UI, and follows recommended Android architecture patterns.

## Application Screens

This section will showcase the main user interfaces of the application.

*(You can add your screenshots here later)*

1.  **Login & Registration Screen:** Clean and simple interface for user authentication.
2.  **Home/Map Screen:** The main screen featuring the interactive map with all skate spots.
3.  **Spot Details Screen:** A view showing detailed information about a specific spot, including its name, description, photos, and user ratings.
4.  **Add/Edit Spot Screen:** A form for users to submit new spots or edit existing ones, including a map interface to pinpoint the exact location.


### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio:** Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or a newer version.
- **Kotlin:** The project is configured to use Kotlin.
- **Google Maps API Key:** A valid API key with the **Maps SDK for Android** enabled.
- **Firebase Account:** A Firebase project is required to handle authentication and the database.

### Quickstart Guide ‚ö°Ô∏è

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine or an emulator.

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    # Replace the URL with your repository's URL
    $ git clone https://your-repo-url/where2skate.git
    $ cd where2skate
    ```

2.  **Open in Android Studio**

    Open the cloned project folder in Android Studio. Gradle will automatically start syncing the project dependencies.

3.  **Set up Firebase**

    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    - Add a new Android app to the project, using `com.example.where2skate` as the package name.
    - Follow the setup steps to download the `google-services.json` file.
    - Place the downloaded `google-services.json` file into the `app/` directory of your project.
    - In the Firebase Console, enable **Authentication** (with the Email/Password provider) and **Cloud Firestore**.

4.  **Add Google Maps API Key**

    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/overview) and get your API Key.
    - Make sure the **Maps SDK for Android** is enabled for your key.
    - Open the `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.
    - Find the line with `com.google.android.geo.API_KEY` and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual key.

    ```xml
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
        android:value="AIzaSy...YOUR_REAL_API_KEY" />
    ```

5.  **Build and Run the Application**

    Select a target device (emulator or physical device) and click the "Run" button in Android Studio. The application should build and install.

### Firebase Firestore Rules

For the application to work correctly, you need to set up security rules for your Firestore database. Go to your Firebase project -> Firestore Database -> Rules and paste the following:

```
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Skateparks can be read by anyone, but only created/updated/deleted by logged-in users.
    match /skateparks/{skateparkId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Ratings can be read by anyone.
    // A user can only create a rating if they are logged in.
    // A user can only update/delete their own rating.
    match /ratings/{ratingId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
